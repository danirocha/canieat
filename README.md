# Can I Eat?

A system that estimates how long your meal will take, so you'll never be late for your after-meal meetings again!

## System's purpose

### Problem

At No Worries Company Â©, all teams have 3 hours lunch and their member eat together, two teams at a time. Even though, it seems not to have enough time! Very often, the teams get late for their after-meal meetings, what frustrates them. If only they could estimate how much time it would take to have lunch so they could organize their schedule accordingly...
