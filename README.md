# Can I Eat?

A system that estimates how long your meal will take, so you'll never be late for your after-meals meetings again!

## Problem

At No Worries Company Â©, all teams have 3 hours lunch and their members eat together, two teams at a time. Even though it's a long time, it seems not to be enough! Very often, the teams get late for their after-meals meetings, what frustrates them. If only they could estimate how much time it would take to have lunch, so they could organize their schedules accordingly...

## Solution

Can I Eat wants to help! With its help you'll be able to estimate how much time your team meals will take each. It calculates the time based mainly on the number of people at the table, the preparation time of each meal and how many different dishes you'll eat. Isn't it fun?
